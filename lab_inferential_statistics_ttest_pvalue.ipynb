    "1. *One-tailed t-test* - In a packing plant, a machine packs cartons with jars. It is supposed that a new machine will pack faster on average than the machine currently used. To test that hypothesis, the times each machine takes to pack ten cartons are recorded. The results are in seconds in the tables in the file `files_for_lab/machine.txt`.\n",
    "   Assume that there is sufficient evidence to conduct the t-test, does the data provide sufficient evidence to show if one machine is better than the other?\n",

    "2. *Matched Pairs Test* - In this challenge we will compare dependent samples of data describing our Pokemon (file `files_for_lab/pokemon.csv`). Our goal is to see whether there is a significant difference between each Pokemon's defense and attack scores. Our hypothesis is that the defense and attack scores are equal. Compare the two columns to see if there is a statistically significant difference between them and comment on your result.\n",

You will conduct ANOVA and check if there is any difference in the mean etching rate for different levels of power.
